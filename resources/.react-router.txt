The Router component is part of the React Router API, and its job is to deal with all of the routing-related logic our app will need. Here we specify routing configuration, the mapping between URLs and the views. #<ReactRouter.Route>

eg:
ReactDOM.render(
	<ReactRouter.Router>
		<ReactRouter.Route path="/" component={App}></ReactRouter.Route>
	</ReactRouter.Router>,
	document.querySelector("#container")
);

<ReactRouter> explained:
<ReactRouter.Route path="/" component={App}></ReactRouter.Route>
path property: specifies the URL we are interested in matching
component prop: specify the name of the component

If the URL you are on contains the root, go ahead and display the App component. Because this condition is true when you preview your app, you see the result of what happens when your App component renders.
