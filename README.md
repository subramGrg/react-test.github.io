Welcome.

This is an experimental space for my react app.

### Why?

This repository started as a place where i can push codes for fun but now im considering of using this to create a portfolio page.

Also, this gives me an opportunity to share ideas and techniques that i have gathered while scouring the internet and reading React.js books.
