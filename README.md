# subramGrg.github.io

Welcome.

This is an experimental space for my react app.

## Why?

This repository started as a place where i can push codes for fun but now im considering of using this to create a [portfolio page](https://subramgrg.github.io)

Also, this gives me the opportunity to share ideas and techniques that i have gathered while scouring the internet and reading React.js books.
